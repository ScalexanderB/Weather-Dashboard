# Weather Dashboard

# Steps I took:

* Started by wireframing my application to create a look similar to the mock-up
* Used bootstrap and jquery to create the application and set it's functionallity
* Went through some trial and error in order to get some aspects of the javascript to function, but with enough googling was able to make it work.
